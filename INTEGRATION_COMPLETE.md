# Food-101 Model Integration - Complete!

## ✅ What We've Done

Successfully integrated the Food-101 model into your app to replace part of the Mistral API workflow.

## 🔄 New Workflow

### Before:
```
Image → Mistral API → Ingredients → Playlist
```

### After:
```
Image → Food-101 Model → Food Name → Mistral API → Ingredients → Playlist
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Modified `predict_food101.py`
- Added base64 image support for Flask integration
- Added `preprocess_image_from_base64()` method
- Added `predict_food_from_base64()` method
- Created simple `detect_food_from_base64()` function for app.py

### 2. Updated `app.py`
- Imported `detect_food_from_base64` from predict_food101
- Modified upload route to detect food first, then get ingredients
- Modified analyze_random route to detect food first, then get ingredients
- Added `food_name` to JSON responses

## 🎯 How It Works Now

1. **User uploads image** or clicks "Analyze Random"
2. **Food-101 model** detects the food type (e.g., "pizza", "burger", "sushi")
3. **Mistral/Gemini API** receives prompt: *"This is pizza. List the typical ingredients..."*
4. **API returns ingredients** based on the detected food
5. **Playlist generated** from ingredients

## 🚀 Benefits

- ✅ **More accurate**: Food type is detected before ingredient extraction
- ✅ **Better prompts**: LLM knows what food it's looking at
- ✅ **Cost effective**: Less generic image analysis needed
- ✅ **Faster**: Local model runs quickly
- ✅ **Offline capable**: Food detection works without internet

## 📋 To Run

### Prerequisites:
1. Train the Food-101 model (if not done yet):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python food101_classification.py
```

2. Ensure `food101_trained_model.h5` exists in project root

### Start the App:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

Visit: http://localhost:5000

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Food Detection:
```python
from predict_food101 import detect_food_from_base64
import base64

with open('test_image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    img_b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode('utf-8')

food = detect_food_from_base64(img_b64)
print(f"Detected: {food}")
```

### Test Full Flow:
1. Upload a food image
2. Check console for: `Detected: [food name] ([confidence]%)`
3. Response includes `food_name` field

## 📊 Response Format

### Success Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "food_name": "pizza",
  "ingredients": "dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, basil",
  "playlist": "...",
  "parsed_playlist": [...],
  "source": "uploaded_image"
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Model must be trained first**: Run `food101_classification.py` before using the app
- **First load is slow**: Model loads on first request (~5-10 seconds)
- **Subsequent requests are fast**: Model stays loaded in memory
- **101 food types supported**: If food isn't in Food-101 dataset, prediction may be inaccurate
- **Mistral still needed**: For ingredient extraction and playlist generation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Model Path:
In `predict_food101.py`, modify:
```python
def __init__(self, model_path='food101_trained_model.h5', image_size=(299, 299)):
```

### Adjust Confidence Display:
In `predict_food_from_base64()`:
```python
print(f"Detected: {food_name_clean} ({confidence:.2%} confidence)")
```

### Customize Prompts:
In `app.py`, modify the prompts sent to Mistral:
```python
f"This is {food_name}. List the typical ingredients..."
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

The frontend can now display the detected food type:

```javascript
// In your JavaScript
if (response.success) {
    console.log("Detected food:", response.food_name);
    console.log("Ingredients:", response.ingredients);
    // Display to user
}
```

## 🚧 Next Steps

Optional improvements:
- [ ] Show confidence score to users
- [ ] Add fallback if confidence is low
- [ ] Cache food predictions
- [ ] Add more detailed food descriptions
- [ ] Handle multi-food images
- [ ] Add nutritional information

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Model not found:
```
FileNotFoundError: Model file not found: food101_trained_model.h5
```
**Solution**: Train the model first with `python food101_classification.py`

### Import error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'detect_food_from_base64'
```
**Solution**: Check that predict_food101.py has the updated code

### Wrong predictions:
- Check if food is in the 101 supported classes
- Ensure image is clear and well-lit
- Try with different images

## ✨ Success!

Your app now uses a hybrid approach:
- **Local Food-101 model** for fast, accurate food type detection
- **Mistral/Gemini API** for intelligent ingredient extraction
- **Best of both worlds**: Speed + Intelligence

Enjoy your enhanced food detection app! 🍕🍔🥗
